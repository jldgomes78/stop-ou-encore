This is a simple Python script that is able to:

- Load a gamelist.xml created by ARRM http://www.jujuvincebros.fr/wiki/arrm/doku.php?id=Start (And only ARRM for now)
- tag games with "Accepted", "Rejected" or "On hold"
- Export the Accepted games, icluding an updated gamelist.xml and respective images.
- The program can identify duplicate games with the same name.
- We can also save progress if we are dealing with very large romsets
- We can filter by Letter and by status

It was all created by ChatGPT, however, it took many, many itterations and but fixing to reach this current state.
